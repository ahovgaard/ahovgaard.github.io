title: About
---

<p>I am a Computer Science graduate student
at <a href="http://www.diku.dk/english/">DIKU</a>, University of
Copenhagen. For my master's thesis, I added support for higher-order
functions to the high-performance GPU
language <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark">Futhark</a>.
Earlier, I was a member
of <a href="http://www-kb.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html.en">Kobayashi
Laboratory</a> during my exchange semester at the Graduate School of
Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo.</p>


<p><strong>Interests</strong>: programming languages, type systems,
  functional programming, parallel programming<p>

<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2>Higher-order functions for Futhark</h2>

<p>As part of my thesis, I added support for higher-order functions in
  the compiler for <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark">Futhark</a>,
  a high-performance functional language that generates GPU code.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    To be presented at the <strong>Symposium on Trends in Functional
    Programming
    (<a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~myreen/tfp2018/">TFP
    2018</a>)</strong> in Gothenburg on June 13, 2018. Title:
    <i>High-performance defunctionalization in Futhark</i>. Joint work
    with Troels Henriksen and Martin Elsman.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Formalization of records and subtyping in Twelf</h2>

<p>In this project, I used the Twelf proof assistant to formalize and
mechanically verify the proof of type safety for a simple functional
language with records and restricted algorithmic
subtyping. <a href="https://github.com/ahovgaard/twelf-records">Project
on Github.</a></p>


<h2>klust: Efficient DNA/RNA sequence clustering</h2>

<p>Efficient DNA/RNA sequence clustering using <i>k</i>-mers as an
approximation for sequence similarity. Originally developed
in <a href="https://github.com/Rathcke/klust">bachelor project</a>;
later
as <a href="https://github.com/BIO-DIKU/klust">BIO-DIKU/klust</a>.</p>
